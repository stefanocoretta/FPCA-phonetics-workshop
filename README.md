# Modelling time-varying features of speech: tools and methods
This repository contains didactic material for a course on Functional PCA and Generalised Additive Models (GAMs).

## Installation and prerequisites
It is recommended to work on the latest version of R (4.0.2, or at least major: 4). A few script might give errors when older package versions are used (in particular, dplyr 0.x, while latest is 1.x).

There are only a few R packages that you need, these are listed at the top of scripts/header.R. You need to install them first if you don't have them in your local R. If you have upgraded R to 4.x, the latest packages will be installed.

The exercises (or examples) are the scripts/exXXX.R. To run them, first (and once for all) open scripts/header.R and manually modify home_dir. Then open the script, setwd() to the scripts/ directory, and then execute the scripts normally. The scripts are NOT meant to be executed (sourced) all at once, rather line by line.
